# pythonAutomations

This repository is a collection of python scripts/automations that I am making for fun. Scripting has always seemed cool to me because of how tedious tasks can be completed in an instant. A lot of these scripts will probably not be fully functional but alas, they were fun to make, and I hope you enjoy them for what they are!
