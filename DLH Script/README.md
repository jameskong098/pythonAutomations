Disclaimer: This script was only created for experimental and educational purposes. I, as the creator, do not condone faking any essential tasks such as not filling out
the daily health assessment form. Disclaimer aside, this was fun to see if it could work, but everyone at Brandeis should practice safe health procedures by filling out the 
daily health assessment form normally!

(Also there is a current issue with the DUO push button element not being found...will fix at some point)
